                Welcome to the web page made by a noob from fdu ss class. I write this paragraph just for what is called "water" in Chinese.
                Ignore it. Don’t worry about encountering bugs. After all, everyone is new on the way of coding. If the code you write has no bugs, go
                Apply for exemption. Learning to debug in your messy code will be a very important feature, so you can improve your debug.
                Ping, try to solve errors faster when you can't avoid them.
